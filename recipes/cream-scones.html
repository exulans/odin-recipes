	<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Classic, simple, fluffy American-style scones, to have with butter or jam.</p>
	
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>3 cups (360 g) all purpose flour</li>
		<li>¼-⅓ cups (50-67 g) granulated sugar</li>
		<li>coarse white sparkling sugar</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon table salt</li>
		<li>1⅓-1½ cups (300-340 g) heavy cream (plus more for brushing)</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
		<li><em>(optional)</em> 1-2 cups dried fruit, chocolate chips, or nuts</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Add baking powder, salt, and sugar to the flour and whisk in a bowl.</li>
		<li>Combine the vanilla and cream in a separate, smaller bowl.</li>
		<li>Drizzle the liquid mixture over the dry ingredients, while gently tossing and stirring. So that the dough doesn't get too dense, use large motions of the spatula. Once the dough starts to come together, the fruit or other flavoring can be added. Leave no dry flour at the bottom of the bowl.</li>
		<li>Lightly flour a surface, then spread out the dough into two halves, then form those into 5½" circles about ¾" tall. Again, don't use too much force.</li>
		<li>Brush each circle of dough with cream, and sprinkle with sparkling sugar</li>
		<li>Place the circles of dough on the baking tray, and cut each into 6 wedges. Space the wedges far enough to give them enough space to expand.</li>
		<li>For better rising, place the pan of scones in the freezer for 15 minutes or more. During this time the oven should be able to preheat to 425°F.</li>
		<li>Bake the scones for 14-15 minutes: until they're starting to brown, and baked through with no wet dough at the center.</li>
		<li>Scones can be stored at room temperature sealed for several days. To reheat, microwave for 20-30 seconds, or bake in oven or toaster oven for 10-15 minutes.</li>
	</ol>
